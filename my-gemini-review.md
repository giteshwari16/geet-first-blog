# Stop Googling, Start Creating: My Review of Google Gemini

For years, Geet’s creative and professional process started the same way: with a search. She needed an idea, a fact, or an example, so she "Googled it." But for the past week, she's completely shifted her workflow. Now, when she needs to *create* something, she doesn't go to a search engine. She goes to **Google Gemini**.

This isn't about getting a better answer; it's about getting a better starting point. Geet is no longer just gathering information; she's generating a first draft, a framework, or a creative spark that would have taken her hours to develop on her own.

For instance, she needed to write a social media campaign for a new line of products. Instead of sifting through countless marketing blogs, she gave Gemini a single prompt: "Generate five engaging social media post ideas for a new brand of eco-friendly, reusable coffee cups, targeting college students." In seconds, it gave her not just ideas, but specific calls to action and even hashtag suggestions. It wasn't the final campaign, but it was a perfect foundation that she could then build on with her own unique voice and insights.

She's used it to brainstorm article outlines, draft professional emails from a few bullet points, and even turn a jumble of notes into a structured presentation. It's less like having a digital library and more like having a tireless co-author who's always ready to help.

However, this new way of working has Geet questioning the nature of her own creativity. If the starting point for her work comes from a machine, is the final product still truly hers? Is this a shortcut to better content, or is it a crutch that will eventually dull her own creative edge?

Geet is genuinely excited about this change, but she also has a nagging question. As we rely more and more on AI for our creative work, where do we draw the line?

**What do you think? Does using a tool like Gemini for creative work make the final product less valuable? Or is it simply a new tool for a new era? Share your perspective below!**
